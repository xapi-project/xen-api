#
# Configuration of pre-commit, a Python framework for git hooks.
# pre-commit is run for each git push by GitHub CI. It can run
# locally as well for early feedback and automatic formatting
# like trailing whitespace removal (to be configured later):
#
## For only installing the package itself, run:
# pip3 install pre-commit
#
## For activating it as a pre-commit and pre-push hook (recommended):
# pre-commit install --hook-type pre-push --hook-type pre-commit
#
## For manually executing the pre-push hook:
# pre-commit run -av --hook-stage pre-push
#
default_stages: [commit, push]

# Recommendation for a minimal git pre-push hook:
# While using pre-commit yields great results, it
# is "not fast". Therefore only run it pre-push,
# (but always in GitHub CI of course):
#
# Calls ./pytype_reporter.py in a dedicated venv:
# pre-commit run -av --hook-stage push

        # If a dev's default python3 interpreter is outside that range, but
        # developers have such version installed, it can be configured here:
