.SH NAME
xcp-xapi \- XCP's XenAPI server
.SH DESCRIPTION
The Xen Cloud Platform (XCP) is an open source enterprise-ready server
virtualization and cloud computing platform, with support for a range of
guest operating systems, Linux network and storage support.

XCP addresses the needs of cloud providers, hosting services and data centers
by combining the isolation and multitenancy capabilities of the Xen hypervisor
with enhanced security, storage and network virtualization technologies to
offer a rich set of virtual infrastructure cloud services. The platform
also address user requirements for security, availability, performance and
isolation across both private and public clouds.

XCP consolidates server workloads, enables savings in power, cooling, and
management costs and thus contributing to environmentally sustainable
computing, an increased ability to adapt to ever-changing IT environments,
an optimized use of existing hardware, and an improved level of IT
reliability.

This is the XenAPI server, which provides the control plane for XCP hosts and
resource pools. To manage the XenAPI server, you should use either the XML-RPC
based API, the xe command line tool, or a graphical user interface such as
OpenXenManager.
