# Quick start guide

- Visit <https://xapi-project.github.io/new-docs/> to view the current documentation.

## Required software

The docs use Hugo and the [Hugo Relearn theme](https://mcshelby.github.io/hugo-theme-relearn),
an enhanced fork of the popular Hugo Learn theme.

### Supported versions of Hugo and the Hugo Relearn theme

Hugo Relearn 7.3.2 is currently used (defined by a git tag in `doc/go.mod`).

- The minimum Hugo version required by the Relearn theme is 0.126.0.
- The current Ubuntu `snap` (which provides 0.142.0) also works.

## Installation

- Install Hugo 0.126 or newer (required by the Hugo Relearn theme)
  follow the guidance on <https://gohugo.io/installing>.
  You'll need to install Go as well: see <https://go.dev/>
  - On Ubuntu, use the `snap` package:
    - `sudo snap install hugo` installs the current version
      `apt-get install hugo` would install a version that is too old,
      (this applies up to Ubuntu 24.04)

  - To install Hugo from source, you need a recent `golang-1.2x` compiler:
    - On Ubuntu 22.04, this can be done with:

      ```bash
      sudo apt install golang-1.23-go
      # Add it to your path, assuming your .local/bin/ is early in your PATH:
      ln -s /usr/lib/go-1.23/bin/go ~/.local/bin/go
      go version
      go install github.com/gohugoio/hugo@v0.127.0
      ```

## Development

- Run a local server: `hugo server`
- Open a browser at <http://127.0.0.1:1313/new-docs/>
- Add content to `doc/content/`:
  - Documents are written in Markdown.
  - Please wrap lines in paragraphs to make reviews more manageable.
  - The menu hierarchy comes mainly from the directory structure in `content/`.
  - A file called `_index.md` is needed in a directory to define a new level in the menu.
    - To set the page title,
      [use the front matter](https://gohugo.io/content-management/front-matter/).
  - For a page that has images or other stuff included, it is best to create a new directory:
    Put the contents in an `index.md` file (no `_`) and the related files next to it.
    See <https://gohugo.io/content-management/organization/> for more information.

  See <https://mcshelby.github.io/hugo-theme-relearn/> for more information about
  the features of the Relearn theme, including handy "shortcodes".

Note: When switching versions, before re-generating the documentation using
`hugo server`, delete the previously generated static site using `rm -r docs/public`.

### Notes for supporting current versions of Hugo and the Relearn theme

Backported fixes to support newer Hugo versions:

- `layouts/partials/header.html`, it fixes:
  ```js
  ERROR deprecated: .Sites.First was deprecated in Hugo v0.127.0 and will be removed in Hugo 0.143.0. Use .Sites.Default instead.
  ```
- `layouts/partials/menu.html`, it fixes:
  ```js
  ERROR deprecated: .Site.IsMultiLingual was deprecated in Hugo v0.124.0 and will be removed in Hugo 0.143.0. Use hugo.IsMultilingual instead.
  ```

The fixes for those issues were backported from the Hugo Relearn v7.x.x theme.
When updating to Hugo Relearn 7.x.x, please remove them (if possible).

#### Tips when upgradubg to newer Hugo Relearn versions

Check the release notes of the Hugo Relearn theme for breaking changes:
