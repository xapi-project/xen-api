VM.clone or VM.copy (or VM.import) is a better choice in almost all situations. The standard way to obtain a new VM is to call VM.clone on a template VM, then call VM.provision on the new clone.

Any software that calls VM.create on a future version of this API may fail or give unexpected results. For example this could happen if an additional parameter were added to VM.create. VM.create is intended only for use in the automatic creation of the system VM templates. It creates a new VM instance, and returns its handle.\nThe constructor args are: name_label, name_description, power_state, user_version*, is_a_template*, suspend_VDI, affinity*, memory_target, memory_static_max*, memory_dynamic_max*, memory_dynamic_min*, memory_static_min*, VCPUs_params*, VCPUs_max*, VCPUs_at_startup*, actions_after_softreboot, actions_after_shutdown*, actions_after_reboot*, actions_after_crash*, PV_bootloader*, PV_kernel*, PV_ramdisk*, PV_args*, PV_bootloader_args*, PV_legacy_args*, HVM_boot_policy*, HVM_boot_params*, HVM_shadow_multiplier, platform*, PCI_bus*, other_config*, last_boot_CPU_flags, last_booted_record, recommendations*, xenstore_data, ha_always_run, ha_restart_priority, tags, blocked_operations, protection_policy, is_snapshot_from_vmpp, snapshot_schedule, is_vmss_snapshot, appliance, start_delay, shutdown_delay, order, suspend_SR, version, generation_id, hardware_platform_version, has_vendor_device, reference_label, domain_type, NVRAM (* = non-optional).","result":["VM ref","reference to the newly created object"],"params":[{"type":"session ref","name":"session_id","doc":"Reference to a valid session"},{"type":"VM record","name":"args","doc":"All constructor arguments"}],"errors":[],"roles":["pool-admin","pool-operator","vm-power-admin","vm-admin"],"tag":"","lifecycle":{"state":"Published_s","transitions":[{"transition":"published","release":"rio","description":""},{"transition":"changed","release":"1.257.0","description":"possibility to create a VM in suspended mode with a suspend_VDI set"}]},"implicit":true},{"name":"get_by_uuid","description":"Get a reference to the VM instance with the specified UUID.","result":["VM ref","reference to the object"],"params":[{"type":"session ref","name":"session_id","doc":"Reference to a valid session"},{"type":"string","name":"uuid","doc":"UUID of object to return"}],"errors":[],"roles":["pool-admin","pool-operator","vm-power-admin","vm-admin","vm-operator","client-cert","read-only"],"tag":"","lifecycle":{"state":"Published_s","transitions":[{"transition":"published","release":"rio","description":""},{"transition":"changed","release":"1.257.0","description":"possibility to create a VM in suspended mode with a suspend_VDI set"}]},"implicit":true},{"name":"get_record","description":"Get a record containing the current state of the given VM.","result":["VM record","all fields from the object"],"params":[{"type":"session ref","name":"session_id","doc":"Reference to a valid session"},{"type":"VM ref","name":"self","doc":"reference to the object"}],"errors":[],"roles":["pool-admin","pool-operator","vm-power-admin","vm-admin","vm-operator","client-cert","read-only"],"tag":"","lifecycle":{"state":"Published_s","transitions":[{"transition":"published","release":"rio","description":""},{"transition":"changed","release":"1.257.0","description":"possibility to create a VM in suspended mode with a suspend_VDI set"}]},"implicit":true}],"enums":[{"name":"vm_power_state","values":[{"name":"Halted","doc":"VM is offline and not using any resources"},{"name":"Paused","doc":"All resources have been allocated but the VM itself is paused and its vCPUs are not running"},{"name":"Running","doc":"Running"},{"name":"Suspended","doc":"VM state has been saved to disk and it is nolonger running.
