# Coverage configuration
# ----------------------
#
codecov:
  #
  # Show the Codecov status without waiting for other status to pass:
  #
  require_ci_to_pass: false
  notify:
    wait_for_ci: false

github_checks:
  #
  # Disable adding coverage annotations to the code in the GitHub
  # Code Review for now:
  #
  # - The annotations consume a lot of space in the PR code review,
  #   and can make it hard to review files that are not covered yet.
  #
  # - The coverage can be visited using the Codecov link at all times.
  #   https://app.codecov.io/gh/xapi-project/xen-api/pulls
  #
  # - The annotations can be hidden in GitHub PR code review by
  #   pressing the "a" key or by deselecting the "Show comments"
  #   checkbox but they are shown by default.
  #
  # - The Codecov Chrome and Firefox extension is a much nicer
  #   way to indicate coverage:
  #
  #   Link: https://github.com/codecov/codecov-browser-extension
  #
  #   - How to enable: You need to log in to Codecov using Github.
  #     For Firefox, enable the needed permissions:
  #     https://github.com/codecov/codecov-browser-extension/issues/50
  #
  # Reference:

# Pull request comments:
# ----------------------
# This feature adds the code coverage summary as a comment on each PR.
# See https://docs.codecov.io/docs/pull-request-comments
# This same information is available from the Codecov checks in the PR's
# "Checks" tab in GitHub even when this feature is disabled.
#
comment:
  #
  # Legend:
  # "diff" is the Coverage Diff of the pull request.
  # "files" are the files impacted by the pull request
  # "flags" are the coverage status of the pull request
  #
  # For an even shorter layout, this may be used:
  # layout: "condensed_header, diff, files, flags"
  #
  layout: "header, diff, files, flags"

  # Only add the Codecov comment to the PR when coverage changes

#
# Coverage limits and display details:
# ------------------------------------
#
coverage:

  #
  # Number of precision digits when showing coverage percentage e.g. 82.1%:
  #
  precision: 1

  #
  # Commit status checks and display:
  # ---------------------------------
  # https://docs.codecov.io/docs/commit-status
  #
  # target: Fail the PR if coverage is below that
  # threshold: Allow reducing coverage by this amount
  #
  # - The values added are a very generous, friendly limit to not block most PRs
  #
  # - XAPI maintainers may tighten these screws more to require better tests
  #
  status: # global coverage status and limits
