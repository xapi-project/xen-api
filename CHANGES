0.9.2 (2018-02-27)
* Fix exception handling in lwt really_{read,write}
* Add missing jbuilder build dependency in the opam file

0.9.1 (2017-12-11)
* Fix build of vhd-format-lwt package

0.9.0 (2017-12-08)
* Update to Mirage 3
* Port to jbuilder
* Split the original OPAM package into two: vhd-format for the core library and
  vhd-format-lwt for the Lwt-specific parts, with corresponding ocamlfind libraries
  vhd-format and vhd-format-lwt, and top-level modules Vhd_format and Vhd_format_lwt,
  respectively.

0.8.0 (2016-09-26)
* Ported to ppx instead of camlp4. This bumps up the minimum version
  of OCaml required to 4.02.3, but removes upper bounds on libraries (@avsm)
* Improved Travis CI test coverage to use Docker for multi-distro
  Linux support (@avsm)
* Add Alpine Linux depexts for linux-kernel-headers (@avsm)

0.7.4 (2016-09-13)
* Bug fixes for SEEK_DATA and SEEK_HOLE (@lesserevil and @lindig)
* Bug fixes for when the VHD chain contains different sized VHDs (@zli)

0.7.3 (2015-09-11)
* add explicit `connect` to interface (@talex5)
* add tests for streaming code (@jonludlam)
* support SEEK_DATA and SEEK_HOLE (@djs55)
* fix bug walking over sector bitmaps (@jonludlam)

0.7.2 (2014-10-02)
* vhd: add ability to resize (i.e. shrink) a vhd
* vhd: add ability to marshal (and hence update) a parent locator

0.7.1 (2014-07-03)
* build fixes for OS X
* fix block access after a resize

0.7.0 (2014-01-30)
* vhd: always interpret relative paths in parent locators as being relative to
  the current directory of the file containing the locator first, and then search
  the general search path after.
* deltas: handle cases where parent filenames are different strings but refer
  to the same file (e.g. "foo", "./foo")
* vhd: rename Vhd_input.hybrid -> Hybrid_input.raw
* vhd: add Hybrid_input.vhd to output vhd-formatted data
* vhd: fix stream size calculation, so progress reports (bars?) will be more accurate
* vhd: rename 'openfile' to 'openchain' to reflect that it opens an entire chain,
  or fails trying
* vhd: add 'openfile' which only opens a single file
* switch result type to a polymorphic variant
* switch Element type to a polymorphic variant
* rename the module Vhd to module F
* pack Vhd modules
* vhd: user passes in buffers to read and write, to control allocation
* vhd: write now uses the bitmap cache
* vhd: read and write now try to issue I/O in parallel (experimental)

0.6.4 (2013-11-06)
* vhd: we expect parent locators to have prefix "file://", rather than "file://./"

0.6.3 (2013-11-01)
* vhd: always open parents read/only; add a read/write boolean to openfile

0.6.2 (2013-10-31)
* fixes openfile on 32-bit machines for disks > 4GiB

0.6.1 (2013-10-30)
* raw: use BLKGETSIZE64 to query the size if stat(2) reveals we've been given
  a block device. Otherwise we use a file size of 0 and don't copy anything.

0.6.0 (2013-10-02)
* move CLI tools to vhd-tool repo
* can parse and print XenServer 'batmaps'
* add a vhd search path, for parent locators with relative paths

0.5.1 (2013-09-27)
* cope with vhds with over-size BATs
* respect --prezeroed when streaming into raw format

0.5.0 (2013-09-23)
* new streaming interface supporting both raw and vhd formats
* uses O_DIRECT by default
* added lots of edge-case unit tests
* sparse_dd implementation
* vhd-tool CLI prototype

0.0.2 (2013-07-25):
* rename to vhd-format in ocamlfind
* start adding some unit tests

0.0.1 (2013-07-25):
* Initial development snapshot
