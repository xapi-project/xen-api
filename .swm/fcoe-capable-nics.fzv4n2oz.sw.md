title: FCoE capable NICs
---
It has been possible to identify the NICs of a Host which can support FCoE. This property can be listed in PIF object under capabilities field.

## Introduction

- FCoE supported on a NIC is a hardware property. With the help of dcbtool, we can identify which NIC support FCoE.
- The new field capabilities will be `Set(String)` in PIF object. For FCoE capable NIC will have string "fcoe" in PIF capabilities field.
- `capabilities` field will be ReadOnly, This field cannot be modified by user.

## PIF Object

New field:

- Field `PIF.capabilities` will be type `Set(string)`.
- Default value in PIF capabilities will have an empty set.

## Xapi Changes

- Set the field capabilities "fcoe" depending on output of xcp-networkd call `get_capabilities`.
- Field capabilities "fcoe" can be set during `introduce_internal` on when creating a PIF.
- Field capabilities "fcoe" can be updated during `refresh_all` on xapi startup.
- The above field will be set everytime when xapi-restart.

## XCP-Networkd Changes

New function:

- String list `string list get_capabilties (string)`
- Argument: device_name for the PIF.
- This function calls method `capable` exposed by `fcoe_driver.py` as part of dom0.
- It returns string list \["fcoe"\] or \[\] depending on `capable` method output.

## Defaults, Installation and Upgrade

- Any newly introduced PIF will have its capabilities field as empty set until `fcoe_driver` method `capable` states FCoE is supported on the NIC.
- It includes PIFs obtained after a fresh install of Xenserver, as well as PIFs created using `PIF.introduce` then `PIF.scan`.
- During an upgrade Xapi Restart will call `refresh_all` which then populate the capabilities field as empty set.

## Command Line Interface

- The `PIF.capabilities` field is exposed through `xe pif-list` and `xe pif-param-list` as usual.
