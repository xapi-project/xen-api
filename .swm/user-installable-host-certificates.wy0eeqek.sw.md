title: User-installable host certificates
---
## Introduction

It is often necessary to replace the TLS certificate used to secure communications to Xenservers hosts, for example to allow a XenAPI user such as Citrix Virtual Apps and Desktops (CVAD) to validate that the host is genuine and not impersonating the actual host.

Historically there has not been a supported mechanism to do this, and as a result users have had to rely on guides written by third parties that show how to manually replace the xapi-ssl.pem file on a host. This process is error-prone, and if a mistake is made, can result in an unuseable system. This design provides a fully supported mechanism to allow replacing the certificates.

## Design proposal

It is expected that an API caller will provide, in a single API call, a private key, and one or more certificates for use on the host. The key will be provided in PKCS #8 format, and the certificates in X509 format, both in base-64-encoded PEM containers.

Multiple certificates can be provided to cater for the case where an intermediate certificate or certificates are required for the caller to be able to verify the certificate back to a trusted root (best practice for Certificate Authorities is to have an 'offline' root, and issue certificates from an intermediate Certificate Authority). In this situation, it is expected (and common practice among other tools) that the first certificate provided in the chain is the host's unique server certificate, and subsequent certificates form the chain.

To detect mistakes a user may make, certain checks will be carried out on the provided key and certificate(s) before they are used on the host. If all checks pass, the key and certificate(s) will be written to the host, at which stage a signal will be sent to stunnel that will cause it to start serving the new certificate.

## Certificate Installation

### API Additions

Xapi must provide an API call through Host RPC API to install host certificates:

```ocaml
let install_server_certificate = call
    ~lifecycle:[Published, rel_stockholm, ""]
    ~name:"install_server_certificate"
    ~doc:"Install the TLS server certificate."
    ~versioned_params:
      [{ param_type=Ref _host; param_name="host"; param_doc="The host"
       ; param_release=stockholm_release; param_default=None}
      ;{ param_type=String; param_name="certificate"
       ; param_doc="The server certificate, in PEM form"
       ; param_release=stockholm_release; param_default=None}
      ;{ param_type=String; param_name="private_key"
       ; param_doc="The unencrypted private key used to sign the certificate, \
                    in PKCS#8 form"
       ; param_release=stockholm_release; param_default=None}
      ;{ param_type=String; param_name="certificate_chain"
       ; param_doc="The certificate chain, in PEM form"
       ; param_release=stockholm_release; param_default=Some (VString "")}
      ]
    ~allowed_roles:_R_POOL_ADMIN
    ()
```

This call should be implemented within xapi, using the already-existing crypto libraries available to it.

Analogous to the API call, a new CLI call `host-server-certificate-install` must be introduced, which takes the parameters `certificate`, `key` and `certificate-chain` - these parameters are expected to be filenames, from which the key and certificate(s) must be read, and passed to the `install_server_certificate` RPC call.

The CLI will be defined as:

```ocaml
"host-server-certificate-install",
{
  reqd=["certificate"; "private-key"];
  optn=["certificate-chain"];
  help="Install a server TLS certificate on a host";
  implementation=With_fd Cli_operations.host_install_server_certificate;
  flags=[ Host_selectors ];
};
```

### Validation

Xapi must perform the following validation steps on the provided key and certificate. If any validation step fails, the API call must return an error with the specified error code, providing any associated text:

### Private Key

- Validate that it is a pem-encoded PKCS#8 key, use error `SERVER_CERTIFICATE_KEY_INVALID []` and exposed as "The provided key is not in a pem-encoded PKCS#8 format."

- Validate that the algorithm of the key is RSA, use error `SERVER_CERTIFICATE_KEY_ALGORITHM_NOT_SUPPORTED, [<algorithms's ASN.1 OID>]` and exposed as "The provided key uses an unsupported algorithm."

- Validate that the key length is ≥ 2048, and ≤ 4096 bits, use error `SERVER_CERTIFICATE_KEY_RSA_LENGTH_NOT_SUPPORTED, [length]` and exposed as "The provided RSA key does not have a length between 2048 and 4096."

- The library used does not support multi-prime RSA keys, when it's encountered use error `SERVER_CERTIFICATE_KEY_RSA_MULTI_NOT_SUPPORTED []` and exposed as "The provided RSA key is using more than 2 primes, expecting only 2"

#### Server Certificate

- Validate that it is a pem-encoded X509 certificate, use error `SERVER_CERTIFICATE_INVALID []` and exposed as "The provided certificate is not in a pem-encoded X509."

- Validate that the public key of the certificate matches the public key from the private key, using error `SERVER_CERTIFICATE_KEY_MISMATCH []` and exposing it as "The provided key does not match the provided certificate's public key."

- Validate that the certificate is currently valid. (ensure all time comparisons are done using UTC, and any times presented in errors are using ISO8601 format):

  - Ensure the certificate's `not_before` date is ≤ NOW `SERVER_CERTIFICATE_NOT_VALID_YET, [<NOW>; <not_before>]` and exposed as "The provided certificate certificate is not valid yet."

  - Ensure the certificate's `not_after` date is > NOW `SERVER_CERTIFICATE_EXPIRED, [<NOW>; <not_after>]` and exposed as "The provided certificate has expired."

- Validate that the certificate signature algorithm is SHA-256 `SERVER_CERTIFICATE_SIGNATURE_NOT_SUPPORTED []` and exposed as "The provided certificate is not using the SHA256 (SHA2) signature algorithm."

#### Intermediate Certificates

- Validate that it is an X509 certificate, use `SERVER_CERTIFICATE_CHAIN_INVALID []` and exposed as "The provided intermediate certificates are not in a pem-encoded X509."

### Filesystem Interaction

If validation has been completed successfully, a temporary file must be created with permissions 0x400 containing the key and certificate(s), in that order, separated by an empty line.

This file must then be atomically moved to /etc/xensource/xapi-ssl.pem in order to ensure the integrity of the contents. This may be done using rename with the origin and destination in the same mount-point.

## Alerting

A daily task must be added. This task must check the expiry date of the first certificate present in /etc/xensource/xapi-ssl.pem, and if it is within 30 days of expiry, generate a `message` to alert the administrator that the certificate is due to expire shortly.

The body of the message should contain:

```
<body>
  <message>
    The TLS server certificate is expiring soon
  </message>
  <date>
    <expiry date in ISO8601 'YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssZ' format>`
  </date>
</body>

```

The priority of the message should be based on the number of days to expiry as follows:

| Number of days | Priority |
| -------------- | -------- |
| 0-7            | 1        |
| 8-14           | 2        |
| 14+            | 3        |

The other fields of the message should be:

| Field    | Value                            |
| -------- | -------------------------------- |
| name     | HOST_SERVER_CERTIFICATE_EXPIRING |
| class    | Host                             |
| obj-uuid | < Host UUID >                    |

Any existing `HOST_SERVER_CERTIFICATE_EXPIRING` messages with this host's UUID should be removed to avoid a build-up of messages.

Additionally, the task may also produce messages for expired server certificates which must use the name `HOST_SERVER_CERTIFICATE_EXPIRED`. These kind of message must contain the message "The TLS server certificate has expired." as well as the expiry date, like the expiring messages. They also may replace the existing expiring messages in a host.

## Expose Certificate metadata

Currently xapi exposes a CLI command to print the certificate being used to verify external hosts. We would like to also expose through the API and the CLI useful metadata about the certificates in use by each host.

The new class is meant to cover server certificates and trusted certificates.

### Schema

A new class, Certificate, will be added with the following schema:

| Field              | Type       | Notes                                                |
| ------------------ | ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| uuid               |            |                                                      |
| type               | CA         | Certificate trusted by all hosts                     |
|                    | Host       | Certificate that the host present sto normal clients |
| name               | String     | Name, only present for trusted certificates          |
| host               | Ref \_host | Host where the certificate is installed              |
| not_before         | DateTime   | Date after which the certificate is valid            |
| not_after          | DateTime   | Date before which the certificate is valid           |
| fingerprint_sha256 | String     | The certificate's SHA256 fingerprint / hash          |
| fingerprint_sha1   | String     | The certificate's SHA1 fingerprint / hash            |

### CLI / API

There are currently-existing CLI parameters for certificates: `pool-certificate-{install,uninstall,list,sync}`, `pool-crl-{install,uninstall,list}` and `host-get-server-certificate`.

The new command must show the metadata of installed server certificates in the pool. It must be able to show all of them in the same call, and be able to filter the certificates per-host.

To make it easy to separate it from the previous calls and to reflect that certificates are a class type in xapi the call will be named `certificate-list` and it will accept the parameter `host-uuid=<uuid>`.

## Recovery mechanism

In the case a certificate is let to expire TLS clients connecting to the host will refuse establish the connection. This means that the host is going to be unable to be managed using the xapi API (Xencenter, or a CVAD control plane)

There needs to be a mechanism to recover from this situation. A CLI command must be provided to install a self-signed certificate, in the same way it is generated during the setup process at the moment. The command will be `host-emergency-reset-server-certificate`. This command is never to be forwarded to another host and will call openssl to create a new RSA private key

The command must notify stunnel to make sure stunnel uses the newly-created certificate.

# Miscellaneous

The auto-generated `xapi-ssl.pem` currently contains Diffie-Hellman (DH) Parameters, specifically 512 bits worth. We no longer support any ciphers which require DH parameters, so these are no longer needed, and it is acceptable for them to be lost as part of installing a new certificate/key pair.

The generation should also be modified to avoid creating these for new installations.
