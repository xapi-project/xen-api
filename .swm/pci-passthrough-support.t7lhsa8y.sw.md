title: PCI passthrough support
---
## Introduction

GPU passthrough is already available in XAPI, this document proposes to also offer passthrough for all PCI devices through XAPI.

## Design proposal

New methods for PCI object:

- `PCI.enable_dom0_access`

- `PCI.disable_dom0_access`

- `PCI.get_dom0_access_status`: compares the outputs of `/opt/xensource/libexec/xen-cmdline` and `/proc/cmdline` to produce one of the four values that can be currently contained in the `PGPU.dom0_access` field:

  - disabled
  - disabled_on_reboot
  - enabled
  - enabled_on_reboot

  How do determine the expected dom0 access state: If the device id is present in both `pciback.hide` of `/proc/cmdline` and `xen-cmdline`: `enabled` If the device id is present not in both `pciback.hide` of `/proc/cmdline` and `xen-cmdline`: `disabled` If the device id is present in the `pciback.hide` of `/proc/cmdline` but not in the one of `xen-cmdline`: `disabled_on_reboot` If the device id is not present in the `pciback.hide` of `/proc/cmdline` but is in the one of `xen-cmdline`: `enabled_on_reboot`

  A function rather than a field makes the data always accurate and even accounts for changes made by users outside XAPI, directly through `/opt/xensource/libexec/xen-cmdline`

With these generic methods available, the following field and methods will be *deprecated*:

- `PGPU.enable_dom0_access`
- `PGPU.disable_dom0_access`
- `PGPU.dom0_access` (DB field)

They would still be usable and up to date with the same info as for the PCI methods.

## Test cases

- hide a PCI:

  - call `PCI.disable_dom0_access` on an `enabled` PCI
  - check the PCI goes in state `disabled_on_reboot`
  - reboot the host
  - check the PCI goes in state `disabled`

- unhide a PCI:

  - call `PCI.enable_dom0_access` on an `disabled` PCI
  - check the PCI goes in state `enabled_on_reboot`
  - reboot the host
  - check the PCI goes in state `enabled`

- get a PCI dom0 access state:

  - on a `enabled` PCI, make sure the `get_dom0_access_status` returns `enabled`
  - hide the PCI
  - make sure the `get_dom0_access_status` returns `disabled_on_reboot`
  - reboot
  - make sure the `get_dom0_access_status` returns `disabled`
  - unhide the PCI
  - make sure the `get_dom0_access_status` returns `enabled_on_reboot`
  - reboot
  - make sure the `get_dom0_access_status` returns `enabled`

- Check PCI/PGPU dom0 access coherence:

  - hide a PCI belonging to a PGPU and make sure both states remains coherent at every step
  - unhide a PCI belonging to a PGPU and make sure both states remains coherent at every step
  - hide a PGPU and make sure its and its PCI's states remains coherent at every step
  - unhide a PGPU and make sure its and its PCI's states remains coherent at every step
