title: Improving snapshot revert behaviour
---
Currently there is a XenAPI `VM.revert` which reverts a "VM" to the state it was in when a VM-level snapshot was taken. There is no `VDI.revert` so `VM.revert` uses `VDI.clone` to change the state of the disks.

The use of `VDI.clone` has the side-effect of changing VDI refs and uuids. This causes the following problems:

- It is difficult for clients such as [Apache CloudStack](http://cloudstack.apache.org) to keep track of the disks it is actively managing
- VDI snapshot metadata (`VDI.snapshot_of` et al) has to be carefully fixed up since all the old refs are now dangling

We will fix these problems by:

1. adding a `VDI.revert` to the SMAPIv2 and calling this from `VM.revert`
2. defining a new SMAPIv1 operation `vdi_revert` and a corresponding capability `VDI_REVERT`
3. the Xapi implementation of `VDI.revert` will first try the `vdi_revert`, and fall back to `VDI.clone` if that fails
4. implement `vdi_revert` for common storage types, including File and LVM-based SRs.

## XenAPI changes

We will add the function `VDI.revert` with arguments:

- in: `snapshot: Ref(VDI)`: the snapshot to which we want to revert
- in: `driver_params: Map(String,String)`: optional extra parameters
- out: `Ref(VDI)` the new VDI

The function will look up the VDI which this is a `snapshot_of`, and change the VDI to have the same contents as the snapshot. The snapshot will not be modified. If the implementation is able to revert in-place, then the reference returned will be the VDI this is a `snapshot_of`; otherwise it is a reference to a fresh VDI (created by the `VDI.clone` fallback path)

## SMAPIv1 changes

We will define the function `vdi_revert` with arguments:

- in: `sr_uuid`: the UUID of the SR containing both the VDI and the snapshot
- in: `vdi_uuid`: the UUID of the snapshot whose contents should be duplicated
- in: `target_uuid`: the UUID of the target whose contents should be replaced

The function will replace the contents of the `target_uuid` VDI with the contents of the `vdi_uuid` VDI without changing the identify of the target (i.e. name-label, uuid and location are guaranteed to remain the same). The `vdi_uuid` is preserved by this operation. The operation is obvoiusly idempotent.

## Xapi changes

Xapi will

- use `VDI.revert` in the `VM.revert` code-path
- expose a new `xe vdi-revert` CLI command
- implement the `VDI.revert` by calling the SMAPIv1 function and falling back to `VDI.clone` if a `Not_implemented` exception is thrown

## SM changes

We will modify

- [SRCommand.py](http://SRCommand.py) and [VDI.py](http://VDI.py) to add a new `vdi_revert` function which throws a 'not implemented' exception
- [FileSR.py](http://FileSR.py) to implement `VDI.revert` using a variant of the existing snapshot/clone machinery
- [EXTSR.py](http://EXTSR.py) and [NFSSR.py](http://NFSSR.py) to advertise the `VDI_REVERT` capability
- [LVHDSR.py](http://LVHDSR.py) to implement `VDI.revert` using a variant of the existing snapshot/clone machinery
- [LVHDoISCSISR.py](http://LVHDoISCSISR.py) and [LVHDoHBASR.py](http://LVHDoHBASR.py) to advertise the `VDI_REVERT` capability
