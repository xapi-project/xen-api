# XAPI and XenAPI

## Creating a Bond

### Current Behaviour on Bond creation

Steps for a user to create a bond:

1. Shutdown all VMs with VIFs using the interfaces that will be bonded, in order to unplug those VIFs.
2. Create a Network to be used by the bond: `Network.create`
3. Call `Bond.create` with a ref to this Network, a list of refs of slave PIFs, and a MAC address to use.
4. Call `PIF.reconfigure_ip` to configure the bond master.
5. Call `Host.management_reconfigure` if one of the slaves is the management interface. This command will call `interface-reconfigure` to bring up the master and bring down the slave PIFs, thereby activating the bond. Otherwise, call `PIF.plug` to activate the bond.

`Bond.create` XenAPI call:

1. Remove duplicates in the list of slaves.

2. Validate the following:

   - Slaves must not be in a bond already.
   - Slaves must not be VLAN masters.
   - Slaves must be on the same host.
   - Network does not already have a PIF on the same host as the slaves.
   - The given MAC is valid.

3. Create the master PIF object.

   - The device name of this PIF is `bond`*x*, with *x* the smallest unused non-negative integer.
   - The MAC of the first-named slave is used if no MAC was specified.

4. Create the Bond object, specifying a reference to the master. The value of the `PIF.master_of` field on the master is dynamically computed on request.

5. Set the `PIF.bond_slave_of` fields of the slaves. The value of the `Bond.slaves` field is dynamically computed on request.

### New Behaviour on Bond creation

Steps for a user to create a bond:

1. Create a Network to be used by the bond: `Network.create`
2. Call `Bond.create` with a ref to this Network, a list of refs of slave PIFs, and a MAC address to use.\
   The new bond will automatically be plugged if one of the slaves was plugged.

In the following, for a host *h*, a *VIF-to-move* is a VIF associated with a VM that is either

- running, suspended or paused on *h*, OR
- halted, and *h* is the only host that the VM can be started on.

The `Bond.create` XenAPI call is updated to do the following:

 1. Remove duplicates in the list of slaves.

 2. Validate the following, and raise an exception if any of these check fails:

    - Slaves must not be in a bond already.
    - Slaves must not be VLAN masters.
    - Slaves must not be Tunnel access PIFs.
    - Slaves must be on the same host.
    - Network does not already have a PIF on the same host as the slaves.
    - The given MAC is valid.

 3. Try unplugging all currently attached VIFs of the set of VIFs that need to be moved. Roll back and raise an exception of one of the VIFs cannot be unplugged (e.g. due to the absence of PV drivers in the VM).

 4. Determine the *primary slave*: the management PIF (if among the slaves), or the first slave with IP configuration.

 5. Create the master PIF object.

    - The device name of this PIF is `bond`*x*, with *x* the smallest unused non-negative integer.
    - The MAC of the primary slave is used if no MAC was specified.
    - Include the IP configuration of the primary slave.
    - If any of the slaves has `PIF.disallow_unplug = true`, this will be copied to the master.

 6. Create the Bond object, specifying a reference to the master. The value of the `PIF.master_of` field on the master is dynamically computed on request. Also a reference to the primary slave is written to `Bond.primary_slave` on the new Bond object.

 7. Set the `PIF.bond_slave_of` fields of the slaves. The value of the `Bond.slaves` field is dynamically computed on request.

 8. Move VLANs, plus the VIFs-to-move on them, to the master.

    - If all VLANs on the slaves have different tags, all VLANs will be moved to the bond master, while the same Network is used. The network effectively moves up to the bond and therefore no VIFs need to be moved.
    - If multiple VLANs on different slaves have the same tag, they necessarily have different Networks as well. Only one VLAN with this tag is created on the bond master. All VIFs-to-move on the remaining VLAN networks are moved to the Network that was moved up.

 9. Move Tunnels to the master. The tunnel Networks move up with the tunnels. As tunnel keys are different for all tunnel networks, there are no complications as in the VLAN case.

10. Move VIFs-to-move on the slaves to the master.

11. If one of the slaves is the current management interface, move management to the master; the master will automatically be plugged. If none of the slaves is the management interface, plug the master if any of the slaves was plugged. In both cases, the slaves will automatically be unplugged.

12. On all slaves, reset the IP configuration and set `disallow_unplug` to false.

*Note: "moving" a VIF, VLAN or tunnel means "re-creating somewhere else, and destroying the old one".*

## Destroying a Bond

### Current Behaviour on Bond destruction

Steps for a user to destroy a bond:

1. If the management interface is on the bond, move it to another PIF using `PIF.reconfigure_ip` and `Host.management_reconfigure`. Otherwise, no `PIF.unplug` needs to be called on the bond master, as `Bond.destroy` does this automatically.
2. Call `Bond.destroy` with a ref to the Bond object.
3. If desired, bring up the former slave PIFs by calls to `PIF.plug` (this is does not happen automatically).

`Bond.destroy` XenAPI call:

1. Validate the following constraints:

   - No VLANs are attached to the bond master.
   - The bond master is not the management PIF.

2. Bring down the master PIF and clean up the underlying network devices.

3. Remove the Bond and master PIF objects.

### New Behaviour on Bond destruction

Steps for a user to destroy a bond:

1. Call `Bond.destroy` with a ref to the Bond object.
2. If desired, move VIFs/VLANs/tunnels/management from (former) primary slave to other PIFs.

`Bond.destroy` XenAPI call is updated to do the following:

1. Try unplugging all currently attached VIFs of the set of VIFs that need to be moved. Roll back and raise an exception of one of the VIFs cannot be unplugged (e.g. due to the absence of PV drivers in the VM).
2. Copy the IP configuration of the master to the primary slave.
3. Move VLANs, with their Networks, to the primary slave.
4. Move Tunnels, with their Networks, to the primary slave.
5. Move VIFs-to-move on the master to the primary slave.
6. If the master is the current management interface, move management to the primary slave. The primary slave will automatically be plugged.
7. If the master was plugged, plug the primary slave. This will automatically clean up the underlying devices of the bond.
8. If the master has `PIF.disallow_unplug = true`, this will be copied to the primary slave.
9. Remove the Bond and master PIF objects.

## Using Bond Slaves

### Current Behaviour for Bond Slaves

- It possible to plug any existing PIF, even bond slaves. Any other PIFs that cannot be attached at the same time as the PIF that is being plugged, are automatically unplugged.
- Similarly, it is possible to make a bond slave the management interface. Any other PIFs that cannot be attached at the same time as the PIF that is being plugged, are automatically unplugged.
- It is possible to have a VIF on a Network associated with a bond slave. When the VIF's VM is started, or the VIF is hot-plugged, the PIF is relies on is automatically plugged, and any other PIFs that cannot be attached at the same time as this PIF are automatically unplugged.
- It is possible to have a VLAN on a bond slave, though the bond (master) and the VLAN may not be simultaneously attached. This is not currently enforced (which may be considered a bug).

### New behaviour for Bond Slaves

- It is no longer possible to plug a bond slave. The exception CANNOT_PLUG_BOND_SLAVE is raised when trying to do so.
- It is no longer possible to make a bond slave the management interface. The exception CANNOT_PLUG_BOND_SLAVE is raised when trying to do so.
- It is still possible to have a VIF on the Network of a bond slave. However, it is not possible to start such a VIF's VM on a host, if this would need a bond slave to be plugged. Trying this will result in a CANNOT_PLUG_BOND_SLAVE exception. Likewise, it is not possible to hot-plug such a VIF.
- It is no longer possible to place a VLAN on a bond slave. The exception CANNOT_ADD_VLAN_TO_BOND_SLAVE is raised when trying to do so.
- It is no longer possible to place a tunnel on a bond slave. The exception CANNOT_ADD_TUNNEL_TO_BOND_SLAVE is raised when trying to do so.

## Actions on Start-up

### Current Behaviour on Start-up

When a pool slave starts up, bonds and VLANs on the pool master are replicated on the slave:

- Create all VLANs that the master has, but the slave has not. VLANs are identified by their tag, the device name of the slave PIF, and the Networks of the master and slave PIFs.
- Create all bonds that the master has, but the slave has not. If the interfaces needed for the bond are not all available on the slave, a partial bond is created. If some of these interface are already bonded on the slave, this bond is destroyed first.

### New Behaviour on Start-up

- The current VLAN/tunnel/bond recreation code is retained, as it uses the new Bond.create and Bond.destroy functions, and therefore does what it needs to do.
- Before VLAN/tunnel/bond recreation, any violations of the rules defined in R2 are rectified, by moving VIFs, VLANs, tunnels or management up to bonds.

# CLI

The behaviour of the `xe` CLI commands `bond-create`, `bond-destroy`, `pif-plug`, and `host-management-reconfigure` is changed to match their associated XenAPI calls.

# XenCenter

XenCenter already automatically moves the management interface when a bond is created or destroyed. This is no longer necessary, as the `Bond.create/destroy` calls already do this. XenCenter only needs to copy any `PIF.other_config` keys that is needs between primary slave and bond master.

# Manual Tests

- Create a bond of two interfaces...
  - without VIFs/VLANs/management on them;
  - with management on one of them;
  - with a VLAN on one of them;
  - with two VLANs on two different interfaces, having the same VLAN tag;
  - with a VIF associated with a halted VM on one of them;
  - with a VIF associated with a running VM (with and without PV drivers) on one of them.
- Destroy a bond of two interfaces...
  - without VIFs/VLANs/management on it;
  - with management on it;
  - with a VLAN on it;
  - with a VIF associated with a halted VM on it;
  - with a VIF associated with a running VM (with and without PV drivers) on it.
- In a pool of two hosts, having VIFs/VLANs/management on the interfaces of the pool slave, create a bond on the pool master, and restart XAPI on the slave.
- Restart XAPI on a host with a networking configuration that has become illegal due to these requirements.
