Xen API (or xapi) is a management stack that configures and controls
Xen-enabled hosts and resource pools, and co-ordinates resources
within the pool.  Xapi exposes the Xen API interface for many
languages and is a component of the Xen Cloud Platform (XCP) project.
Xen API is written mostly in [Ocaml](http://caml.inria.fr/ocaml/) 3.12.

Xen Cloud Platform (XCP) is an open source enterprise-ready server
virtualization and cloud computing platform.  XCP builds on the Xen
Hypervisor; and provides network and storage support, and management
tools in a single, tested installable image.

XCP runs many guest operating systems, including Linux and Microsoft
Windows.
