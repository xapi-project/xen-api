    [service] as syslog key.  Additional [properties] can be specified
    that are written into the systemd unit file's [Service] section.  By
    default the service is not auto-restarted when it fails, and there
    is a 10s timeout between SIGTERM and SIGKILL on stop.  On failure it
    raises [Spawn_internal_error(stderr, stdout, Unix.process_status)]

val is_active : service:string -> bool
(** [is_active ~service] checks whether the [service] is still running *)

val show : service:string -> status
(** [shows ~service] retrieves the exitcodes and PIDs of the specified [service] *)

val stop : service:string -> status
(** [stop ~service] stops the specified systemd unit (usually a transient service created above).
  * On failure of the command it raises [Spawn_internal_error(stderr, stdout, Unix.process_status)].
  * Returns the service's status, and unloads the unit.

val exists : service:string -> bool
(** [exists ~service] checks whether [service] still exists in systemd.
 * Note: stopped transient services get cleaned up and this will return false *)
