(*
 * Code to store a database and deltas in a block device and retrieve it again later.
 * 
 * This module can be compiled and executed in a stand-alone fashion from the command-line.
 * The filename of the block device and the filename of a file to use as a Unix domain socket are provided as command-line parameters.
 * The process must have read- and write-permission to the block device.
 *)

(*
 * Command-line parameters
 * -----------------------
 *
 * -device		[mandatory] Gives the path to the block device.
 * -ctrlsock <file>	Requests that a file is used as a Unix domain socket to listen on for read/write commands.
 * -datasock <file>	Requests that a file is used as a Unix domain socket to use to transfer database contents.
 * -empty       	Requests that the block device is emptied and re-initialised.
 * -dump		Requests that the contents of the block device are written to STDOUT.
 *
 * The -device option is mandatory. Options -ctrlsock and -datasock must be specified together; these are mutually exclusive with either -empty or -dump.
 *)

(*
 * On-disk structure
 * -----------------
 * 
 * The database is double-buffered, so that in case of corruption or write errors, there will always be an intact version of the data preserved.
 * There is a "validity byte" indicating which buffer is currently being written to.
 * Each buffer starts with a database record followed by zero or more deltas.
 *
 * A database record consists of:
 *
 * bytes | description
 * ------+-----------------------------------
 *    36 | marker
 *    16 | length of database (decimal ASCII)
 * <len> | database (binary data)
 *    36 | marker
 *
 * The two markers in a valid database record are equal.
 *
 * A delta record consists of:
 *
 * bytes | description
 * ------+-----------------------------------
 *    16 | length of delta (decimal ASCII)
 * <len> | delta (binary data)
 *    36 | marker
 *
 * The marker for each delta will be equal to the marker for the database they correspond to.
 *)

(*
 * Communications protocol
 * -----------------------
 * 
 * The control socket is used for another process to send commands and receive responses.
 * The response time for command is guaranteed to be no greater than a particular maximum delay (not accounting for network delay between the processes).
 * If the command could not complete in the available time, the response indicates that it failed.
 *
 * The four commands are:
 *
 * 1. command:   "writedb___|<marker>|<length>|<data>"
 *    response:  "writedb|ack_"  for successful write; or
 *               "writedb|nack"  otherwise
 *
 * 2. command:   "writedelta|<marker>|<length>|<data>"
 *    response:  "writedelta|ack_"  for successful write; or
 *               "writedelta|nack"  otherwise
 *
 * 3. command:   "read______"
 *    response:  "read|db___|<length>|<data>"  then zero or more  "read|delta|<length>|<data>"  and finally  "read|end__"
 *
 * 4. command:   "empty_____"
 *    response:  "empty|ack_"  for successful invalidation; or
 *               "empty|nack"  otherwise
 *)
