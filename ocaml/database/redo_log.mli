    [apply db_fn delta_fn] will cause [db_fn] and [delta_fn] to be invoked for each database or database delta which is read.
    The block device will consist of a sequence of zero or more databases and database deltas.
    For each database, [db_fn] is invoked with the database's generation count, a file descriptor from which to read the database's contents, the length of the database in bytes and the latest response time. The [db_fn] function may raise {!Unixext.Timeout} if the transfer is not complete by the latest response time.
    For each database delta, [delta_fn] is invoked with the delta's generation count and the value of the delta. *)
