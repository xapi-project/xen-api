      but this can be overridden by supplying [?cluster_bits]. Note the cluster size
      must be greater than the sector size on the underlying block device.

      The [?config] argument does not affect the on-disk format but rather the
      behaviour as seen from this client. *)

      The error [`Reference_outside_file (src, dst)] means that at offset [src]
      there is a reference to offset [dst] which is outside the file.
      The error [`Duplicate_reference (ref1, ref2, target) means that references
      at both [ref1] and [ref2] both point to the same [target] offset. *)
