type elt = int64
(** The type of the set elements *)

type interval
(** An interval: a range (x, y) of set values where all the elements from
    x to y inclusive are in the set *)

module Interval: sig
  val make: elt -> elt -> interval
  (** [make first last] construct an interval describing all the elements from
      [first] to [last] inclusive. *)

  val x: interval -> elt
  (** the starting element of the interval *)

  val y: interval -> elt
  (** the ending element of the interval *)

type t
(** The type of sets *)

val make_empty: initial_size:int -> maximum_size:int -> t
(** [make_empty n] creates a set of [initial_size] which can be resized up to
    [maximum size], initially empty *)

val make_full: initial_size:int -> maximum_size:int -> t
(** [make_full n] creates a set of [initial_size] which can be resized up to
    [maximum size], initially full *)

val copy: t -> t
(** [copy t] returns a duplicate of [t] *)

(** [fold f t acc] folds [f] across all the intervals in [t] *)

(** [fold_s f t acc] folds [f] across all the intervals in [t] *)

(** [add interval t] adds the [interval] to [t] in-place *)

(** [remove interval t] removes the [interval] from [t] in-place *)

(** [min_elt t] returns the smallest element, or raises [Not_found] if the set
    is empty. *)
