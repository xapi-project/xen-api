    Thread.delay 0 provides no fairness guarantees, the current thread may actually be the one that gets the global lock again.
    Instead {!val:Thread.yield} could be used, which does provide fairness guarantees, but it may also introduce large latencies
    when there are lots of threads waiting for the OCaml runtime lock.
