    [arg] is an argument that the implementation of [f] can change between recursive calls for its own purposes,
    otherwise [()] can be used.

    A [delay_before] amount of seconds is inserted once, and [delay_between/8] is inserted between recursive calls,
    except the first one, and delays increase exponentially until [delay_between] is reached

      delay_before

            delay_between/4
            f ...
     v}

    The delays are determined by [config], and [delay_between] uses an exponential backoff, up to [config.delay_between] delay.
