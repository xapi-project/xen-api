; we can't install to libexec_root, because the default for that is <prefix>/lib,
; so a plain dune build @install would fail because now it can no longer use <prefix>/lib/wsproxy
; so we install it and then move it in the Makefile

(executable
  (name wsproxy)
  (public_name wsproxy)
  (package xapi-tools)
  (libraries
   fmt
   logs
   logs.fmt
   logs.lwt
   lwt
   lwt.unix
   re
   uuid
   wslib
  )
)
