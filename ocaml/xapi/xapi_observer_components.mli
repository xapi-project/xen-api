val all : t list
(** List of all components available.
  *)

val to_string : t -> string
(** Converts a component type to its string equivalent.
  *)

val of_string : string -> t
(** Convert a string to a component.
  * Raises Unsupported_Component if the component is not supported.
  *)

val startup_components : unit -> t list
(** List of observed components on startup.
  *)

val assert_valid_components : string list -> unit
(** Checks if a given list is made of only string equivalents of supported 
  * components.
  * Raises Server_error if at least one of the elements is invalid.
  *)

val observed_components_of : t list -> t list
(** Transforms a list of components to a list of components that are expected 
  * to be observed. If the list is empty we expect all startup components.
  *)

val is_component_enabled : component:t -> bool
(** Returns [true] if the given component is enabled, [false] otherwise.
  *)

val is_smapi_enabled : unit -> bool
(** Returns [true] if [SMApi] component is enabled, [false] otherwise.
  *)

val dir_name_of_component : t -> string
(** Returns the directory path that python scripts check to see if a component 
  * is enabled.

val env_vars_of_component :
  component:t -> traceparent:string option -> string array
(** Returns an array of environment viariables used by python scripts to 
  *  configure the python observers.
