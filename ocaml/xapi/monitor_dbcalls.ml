(** Monitor DB calls
 * @group Performance Monitoring

(** Here is where all of the calls that touch the database live. There
 * is a thread that sits waiting for the monitor_rrd module (or
 * xapi_pif module) to wake it up so that it writes into the
 * database. We don't particularly care if the db calls block for a
 * while as if the master isn't responding, your problems are larger
 * than having an out-of-date value for the host's memory.
 *
 * The key thing in this module is to know when to push data from the
 * cache into the database. This is usually triggered by edge detection
 * code in monitor_rrds which notices when a value has changed between
 * the last call and the current one. This falls apart when e.g. we've
 * gathered PIF info for an interface that isn't in the database - we
 * try try to update the database with the information and the object
 * isn't there. We don't try to re-issue the db call, so if the PIF is
 * later introduced, it will never get updated with the cached
 * information. In this particular case, we fix this by forcing an
 * update from xapi_pif.ml - but it's important to keep this in mind
 * because it will be quite easy for this code to get out of sync.
