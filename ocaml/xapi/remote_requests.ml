  This module provides a facility to make XML-RPC/HTTPS requests to a remote
  server, and time out the request, killing the stunnel instance if needs be.
  It's used by the WLB code, but could be extended to be used elsewhere in the
  future, hopefully.

  There is a single request-handling thread, onto which requests are
  marshalled.  The thinking here is that there is little point sending
  multiple requests to the WLB server in parallel -- it's unlikely to respond
  any quicker, and this way we reduce the chance of DoS.

  Each request that comes in (on its own task-handling thread) queues the
  request onto the request-handling thread, and then launches a watcher
  thread to handle the timeout.

  If the timeout expires, then the stunnel instance handling the RPC is
  killed, to make cleanup quicker (i.e. to avoid waiting for the TCP timeout).
