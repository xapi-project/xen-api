(* Lazy.t is not thread-safe (it can raise Lazy.undefined), so use a ref instead.
   We only want to initiate the (potentially RPC) call when we know we are
   going to need the result, and then memoize it for the lifetime of this value.
   Useful for example in update_allowed_operations where sometimes you need the
   same value multiple times, but in assert_valid you only need some values for
   the current operation.
