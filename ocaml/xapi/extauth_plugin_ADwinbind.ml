module AuthADWinbind : Auth_signature.AUTH_MODULE = struct
  (* subject_id Authenticate_username_password(string username, string password)

      Takes a username and password, and tries to authenticate against an already configured
      auth service (see XenAPI requirements Wiki page for details of how auth service configuration
      takes place and the appropriate values are stored within the XenServer Metadata).
      If authentication is successful then a subject_id is returned representing the account
      corresponding to the supplied credentials (where the subject_id is in a namespace managed by
      the auth module/service itself -- e.g. maybe a SID or something in the AD case).
      Raises auth_failure if authentication is not successful
  *)

      Takes a subject_name (as may be entered into the XenCenter UI when defining subjects --
      see Access Control wiki page); and resolves it to a subject_id against the external
      auth/directory service.
      Raises Not_found (*Subject_cannot_be_resolved*) if authentication is not succesful.

  (* ((string*string) list) query_subject_information(string subject_identifier)

      Takes a subject_identifier and returns the user record from the directory service as
      key/value pairs. In the returned string*string map, there _must_ be a key called
      subject_name that refers to the name of the account (e.g. the user or group name as may
      be displayed in XenCenter). There is no other requirements to include fields from the user
      record -- initially qI'd imagine that we wouldn't bother adding anything else here, but
      it's a string*string list anyway for possible future expansion.
      Raises Not_found (*Subject_cannot_be_resolved*) if subject_id cannot be resolved by external auth service
  *)
  let query_subject_information subject_identifier =
    failwith "extauth_plugin authenticate_ticket not implemented"

  (* (string list) query_group_membership(string subject_identifier)

      Takes a subject_identifier and returns its group membership (i.e. a list of subject
      identifiers of the groups that the subject passed in belongs to). The set of groups returned
      _must_ be transitively closed wrt the is_member_of relation if the external directory service
      supports nested groups (as AD does for example)

  (* unit on_enable(((string*string) list) config_params)

      Called internally by xapi _on each host_ when a client enables an external auth service for the
      pool via the XenAPI [see AD integration wiki page]. The config_params here are the ones passed
      by the client as part of the corresponding XenAPI call.
      On receiving this hook, the auth module should:
      (i) do whatever it needs to do (if anything) to register with the external auth/directory
          service [using the config params supplied to get access]
      (ii) Write the config_params that it needs to store persistently in the XenServer metadata
          into the Pool.external_auth_configuration field. [Note - the rationale for making the plugin
          write the config params it needs long-term into the XenServer metadata itself is so it can
          explicitly filter any one-time credentials [like AD username/password for example] that it
          does not need long-term.]
