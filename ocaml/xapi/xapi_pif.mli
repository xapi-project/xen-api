(** Module that defines API functions for PIF objects

 *)

(**
A {i PIF} object in the datamodel represents a network interface and contains relevant information about it.
{ul
{- There are three types of PIFs. A PIF can represent...
	{ol
	{- A network-interface card. For each physical interface there should be a PIF. Such a PIF has [PIF.physical = true].}
	{- A bond-master: a higher-level PIF representing the combination of multiple PIFs. Such a PIF has [PIF.bond_master_of] set to the Bond object.}
	{- A VLAN interface: a higher-level PIF (called the {i untagged} PIF, or {i VLAN master} that tags its outgoing traffic before sending it out to the underlying physical interface (the {i tagged} PIF, or {i VLAN slave}).}
	}}
{- PIF objects are typically created automatically on first boot. There is also a [PIF.scan] API call to automatically discover any new network interfaces and create the necessary objects in the database.}
{- A PIF is always accompanied by a Network object (see below) that associates the interface with a bridge.}
{- A PIF can be {i plugged} or {i unplugged}, also known as {i attached} or {i unattached} respectively.
	{ul
	{- Plugging a PIF is also referred to as {i bringing up} the PIF, while unplugging is {i bringing down} a PIF.}
	{- After plugging a PIF, any underlying network devices (bridges, bonds, VLANs, physical interfaces) are configured, such that the interface can be used. Unplugging will clean up any underlying network devices {i that are not used anymore}.}
	{- No PIFs are harmed during unplugging, nor does unplugging have anything to do with pulling out cables.}
	{- A PIF that is plugged has [PIF.currently_attached] set to [true], a PIF that is unplugged has this field set to [false].}
	}}
{- A PIF can be specialised to be...
	{ul
	{- the {i management interface}, which is the interface used by xapi for communication between hosts in a pool and XenAPI clients; this PIF has [PIF.management = true]; the inventory file stores the name of the bridge the the management interface is on (this is where the management interface is ultimately defined);}
	{- dedicated to a specific function, especially for storage traffic (in this case, the [disallow-unplug] field on the PIF is set to [true], and an other-config flag is set); this does not seem to be enforced, but only used by XC.}
	}}
