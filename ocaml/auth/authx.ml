	subject_name that refers to the name of the account (e.g. the user or group name as may

	record -- initially I'd imagine that we wouldn't bother adding anything else here, but

	Called internally by xapi _on each host_ when a client enables an external auth service for the 
	pool via the XenAPI [see AD integration wiki page]. The config_params here are the ones passed 
	by the client as part of the corresponding XenAPI call.
	On receiving this hook, the auth module should:
	(i) do whatever it needs to do (if anything) to register with the external auth/directory 
		service [using the config params supplied to get access]
	(ii) Write the config_params that it needs to store persistently in the XenServer metadata 
		into the Pool.external_auth_configuration field. [Note - the rationale for making the plugin 
		write the config params it needs long-term into the XenServer metadata itself is so it can 
		explicitly filter any one-time credentials [like AD username/password for example] that it 
		does not need long-term.]
*)
let on_enable config_params =
	(* nothing to do in this unix plugin, we always have /etc/passwd and /etc/group *)

(* unit on_disable()

	Called internally by xapi _on each host_ when a client disables an auth service via the XenAPI. 
	The hook will be called _before_ the Pool configuration fields relating to the external-auth 
	service are cleared (i.e. so you can access the config params you need from the pool metadata 
	within the body of the on_disable method)
*)
let on_disable config_params =
	(* nothing to disable in this unix plugin, we should not disable /etc/passwd and /etc/group:) *)

	starting for the first time after a host boot
*)

	(* again, nothing to be initialized here in this unix plugin *)
