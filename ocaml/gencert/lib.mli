(** [install_server_certificate pem_chain pem_leaf pkcs8_private_key

     The 3 elements of the PKCS12 are validated before writing the file and
     the file is written atomically.

     In the case validation fails or the file could not be written an error is
     returned, if the file was successfully written the leaf certificate is
     returned for further inspection, if needed. *)
