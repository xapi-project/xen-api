# XenServer.NET

Copyright (c) 2007-2024 Cloud Software Group, Inc. All Rights Reserved.

XenServer.NET is a complete SDK for XenServer, exposing the XenServer
API as .NET classes. It is written in C#.

XenServer.NET includes a class for every API class, and a method for each API
call, so API documentation and examples written for other languages will apply
equally well to .NET. In particular, the SDK Guide and the Management API Guide
are ideal for developers wishing to use XenServer.NET.
