# XenServer SDK for Go

Copyright (c) 2023-2024 Cloud Software Group, Inc. All Rights Reserved.

XenServer SDK for Go is a complete SDK for XenServer, exposing the XenServer
API as Go module. It is written in Go.

XenServer SDK for Go includes a struct for every API class, and a method for each API
call, so API documentation and examples written for other languages will apply
equally well to Go. In particular, the SDK Guide and the Management API Guide
are ideal for developers wishing to use XenServer SDK for Go.
