# XenAPI Software Development Kit (SDK)

The SDK consists of five components, one for each of C, C#, Java, PowerShell,
and Python, exposing the individual XenAPI calls as first-class functions in the
target language.

The source code for the C, C#, Java, and PowerShell SDK is autogenerated from the
XenAPI's datamodel. The generation code is written in OCaml and is contained in
this directory.

The Python module is not auto-generated, it can be found at
[XenAPI.py](../../scripts/examples/python/XenAPI/XenAPI.py).

To compile the generated source code, follow the instructions in the corresponding
`README` files.

The repository [xenserver/xenserver-samples](https://github.com/xenserver/xenserver-samples)
contains a number of examples for each of the five programming languages to help
you get started with the SDK.
