# XenAPI Software Development Kit (SDK)

The SDK consists of five components, one for each of C, C#, Java, PowerShell,
and Python, exposing the individual XenAPI calls as first-class functions in the
target language.

The source code for the C, C#, Java, and PowerShell SDK is autogenerated from the
XenAPI's datamodel. The generation code is written in OCaml and is contained in
this directory.

The Python module is not auto-generated, it can be found at
[XenAPI.py][../../scripts/examples/python/XenAPI/XenAPI.py].

To compile the generated source code, follow the instructions in the corresponding
README files. The (patched) third party libraries required for the compilation
of the C# and PowerShell source code can be obtained from
[dotnet-packages][https://github.com/xenserver/dotnet-packages].

The repository [xenserver-samples](https://github.com/xenserver/xenserver-samples)
contains a number of examples for each of the five programming languages to help
you get started with the SDK.
